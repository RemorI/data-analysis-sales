# Sales Data Analysis and Database Normalization Project

This project focuses on the normalization and analysis of a large sales database. The main objectives include database normalization to eliminate redundancies and improve data organization. Additionally, the project involves using MySQL to create a structured schema and conduct in-depth analysis of the sales data.


## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **ERD Design**: An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) will be designed using tools like QuickDBD to visualize the database's structure. This ERD provides a blueprint for the database schema, showcasing the relationships between entities.
2. **Database Normalization**: The first step involves normalizing the sales database. This process entails breaking down the data into smaller, related tables, eliminating data redundancies, and establishing appropriate relationships between tables. The goal is to create a well-structured schema that optimizes data storage and retrieval.
3. **Data Analysis**: With the normalized database in place, the project moves on to data analysis. We'll use MySQL queries and possibly other analysis techniques to extract meaningful insights from the sales data. This may include sales trends, customer behavior patterns, product performance analysis, and more.
